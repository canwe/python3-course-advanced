"""
We may have a use case where more than one thread will need to access the same resource at the same time.

A lock is provided by Pythonâ€™s threading module and can be held by either a single thread or no thread at all.
Should a thread try to acquire a lock on a resource that is already locked, 
that thread will basically pause until the lock is released.
